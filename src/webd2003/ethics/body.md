In a career in Information Technology, like many careers, will bring an individual in contact with confidential information and risky situations. Ethical issues quickly arise when any form of hacking a system come into play. A key to success in an IT career is developing a set of principals regarding hacking a system and understanding a what constitutes "grey-hat" hacking. The following principals and guidelines will help an individual make decisions that relate to hacking.

# Career Principals Regarding Hacking

## Validate Hypothesis
Critically thinking is essential to success in IT.  As projects are developed assumptions about requirements have to be validated to ensure the outcome of a project is in fact the desired result. For project involving hacking, not only do the regular assumptions need to be validated but also any assumptions around company policies, the implications of the project, and means by which the project is accomplished. Without an understanding in these areas a range of negative outcomes could result, from dissatisfied clients, to corporate or legal repercussions.

## Treat Hacking/Security Projects With Extra Professionalism
Keeping a Professional appearance in projects that involve hacking will have several benefits to an individual. This will help the client or project sponsor develop trust in the individual that the job will be done correctly. Acting professional by following best-practices, communicating well, and meeting deadlines will reduce the potential form making mistakes.


## Research as much as possible
When hacking a system it is essential to understand as much as possible about it, before even beginning the project. This is necessary since an individual will encounter a variety of scenarios such as being in contact with sensitive data, tampering with production systems, or risking breaching third party licenses or contracts. An individual needs to gather an understanding of the system being hacked, including how it is used, what systems depend on it, and any edge cases that have a possibility of occurring as a result of the project. For example, Without adequate research the project sponsor may not even know that the project would be violating the license of the system being hacked. If the individual failed to realize this they may be  responsible for damages or be personally at fault.   

Depending on the system and the nature of the project there could be severe consequences if a mistake is made or if the hacker doesn't have adequate knowledge of the system. As such, an individual should prepare for all worst case scenarios and have detailed remediation strategies should something go wrong.

## Don't Act Alone
Whenever possible, a hacker should work with others, including security specialists and/or others who are knowledgeable about the system being hacked. This will make completing the project easier and avoid potential pitfalls. Another good practice is to document everything that is done to hack a system. By creating a "paper trail" of activity during hacking exercise any problems at a later date with the system can't be blamed on the hacker.

## Understand the Expected Outcomes of the Project
Without an thorough knowledge of the system, the project, and the tools being used a hacker can easily do more damage than was anticipated. Two major pitfalls that can result in "grey hat" hacking is hacking proprietary third party software and exploiting any systems that contain personal data. Many software licenses include usage agreements and if the software is hacked to be used in some other way this may violate that agreement. When hacking systems with personal or confidential data an individual should know before hand if there is a possibility of coming in contact with that data based on the hacks they will be performing.

# Principals to avoid "Greying one's hat"
## Boasting About Expertise
When an individual boasts or flaunts their expertise in hacking it gives a very weak image of them. An individual should not give off the message that they are capable (and willing) to decrypt passwords, access confidential data, modify software maliciously, or any other form of hacking. Doing so will present the individual as untrustworthy.

## Openly Conducting "Research" from Questionable Sources
Researching exploits and vulnerabilities in public online places where black hat hacking activities should not be conducted on a work laptop or using anything that can identify the individual.

## Conducting Hacking Projects Without the Adequate Authorities Signing Off
Hacking a system without gaining explicit approval could cause an individual to enter the realm of grey hat hacking as they were performing their job, but also using an unapproved means of accomplishing it.

## Hacking Systems to Avoid Policies or License and Government Restrictions
Modify software or hardware for the purpose of concealing activity, or avoiding fees is a sure way for an individual to "grey their hat". In some situations this is activity could be explicitly illegal but in other situations certain hacks may be beneficial to the hacker and doesn't explicitly break any policies or agreements. For example, if a network specialist hacked their router to trick the Internet Service Provider (ISP) into provided more bandwidth, the hacker is now dishonestly using the ISP's service. This activity should be avoided.

## Soliciting or Supporting Other Grey or Black Hat Hackers
Social media is being used increasingly in hiring and evaluating professionals. Not only do hirers look at potential employees' social presence, employers also want to ensure their employees are presenting a positive image of their company. When an individual associates with known grey or black hat hackers or supports their activity in social media this also presents a bad image. Though it doesn't prove that the individual participates in non-white hat hacking it suggests that they may participate if they wanted to.
